In this movie booking ticket app, have integrated several advanced features and architectural patterns. Authentication is managed through middleware, ensuring secure user access. State management is centralized using Redux, which simplifies the handling of application state. Routing is implemented to navigate between different pages seamlessly. Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic, enhancing code maintainability. Lifecycle management is handled with Reactâ€™s hooks, ensuring efficient data fetching and cleanup. Event handling is set up to manage user interactions, and conditional rendering ensures the UI responds appropriately to different states. The app follows a layered architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers, making the codebase more modular and easier to maintain. This combination of techniques results in a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application.
